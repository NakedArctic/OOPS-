        "- Why Polymorphism is Important in OOP\n",
        "Definition:\n",
        "Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the ability of different classes to respond to the same method or function call in a way that is appropriate for their type.\n",
        "In simple terms, polymorphism allows one interface (method name) to be used for different underlying forms (different classes or objects).\n",
        "1. Key Benefits of Polymorphism\n",
        "1.1. Code Reusability\n",
        "Polymorphism allows for writing more generic code that works with objects of different types. Instead of writing different versions of the same function for each class, you can write one method and allow each class to handle it in its own way.\n",
        "This leads to reusable code and less duplication.\n",
        "Example: Code Reusability\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "Edit\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Woof\"\n",

        "animal_sound(bird)  # ✅ Output: Chirp\n",
        "🔹 Here: animal_sound() works for all types of animals (Dog, Cat, Bird), despite them having different speak() methods. Polymorphism allows this generic approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.2. Flexibility and Maintainability\n",
        "With polymorphism, you can modify or extend the behavior of your program without altering the interface. If a new class is added, you don’t need to modify the existing code that uses the common interface. This makes your system more flexible and easier to maintain.\n",
        "Example: Adding New Behavior\n",
        "python\n",

        "animal_sound(cow)   # ✅ Output: Moo\n",
        "🔹 Here: Even after adding the Cow class, the animal_sound() function still works without any changes, which demonstrates the flexibility of polymorphism.\n",

        "1.3. Simplifies Complex Code\n",
        "Polymorphism allows you to use a unified interface for different objects, which helps in managing complexity. Rather than managing multiple if-else or switch-case blocks to handle different object types, polymorphism gives you a cleaner, simpler solution.\n",

        "Q(16)What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a widely used paradigm in software development due to its several advantages. It helps structure code in a way that is more modular, reusable, and maintainable. Here are some of the key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Modularity (Code Organization)\n",
        "Encapsulation in OOP allows for grouping related data and methods together into objects. Each object is a self-contained unit, making it easier to organize and manage code.\n",
        "It encourages modular design, where each class represents a specific entity or concept (e.g., \"Car\", \"Employee\", etc.), reducing complexity in large applications.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A program can be divided into different modules (objects) like:\n",
        "\n",
        "Car, Engine, Wheel, Transmission — each of which represents an individual entity in the real world.\n",
        "2. Reusability (Code Reuse)\n",
        "OOP promotes code reuse through inheritance and composition. Once a class is created, it can be reused to create new classes or even create new systems.\n",
        "By inheriting from existing classes, developers can extend functionality without modifying the original class, ensuring that the core functionality remains unchanged.\n",
        "Libraries and frameworks often utilize OOP to create reusable components that can be incorporated into many projects.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A Vehicle class might have common properties and methods like move() or fuel_efficiency(). A Car class can inherit from Vehicle and add more specific features without rewriting the basic methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Flexibility through Polymorphism\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.\n",
        "This means that a single function can operate on different types of objects, as long as they share a common behavior. This flexibility allows the same code to handle different types of data or behaviors.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A draw() method might be defined for different shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle). The same function can handle each shape without needing to know their exact type.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Maintainability (Easier Maintenance)\n",
        "OOP facilitates maintenance because the code is organized into discrete objects. If changes are required, the modification can be made to a single object (or class) without affecting the entire system.\n",
        "As long as the public interface (methods and properties) remains the same, other parts of the code don’t need to know about the internal changes, making the code more maintainable.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If a new feature needs to be added to the Car class, it can be done in one place, and the rest of the application remains unaffected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Data Security and Integrity (Encapsulation)\n",
        "Encapsulation protects the internal state of objects by hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary data through public methods (getters and setters). This ensures data security and prevents unintended interference.\n",
        "The internal state of an object is protected and can only be modified through well-defined interfaces.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "An Account class might hide sensitive information like the balance, but expose methods like deposit() and withdraw() to interact with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Scalability (Handling Complexity)\n",

        "This reduces clutter and makes the code easier to understand, both for developers and users of the code.\n",
        "By defining abstract methods in a class, developers are forced to consider the general structure of the system rather than focusing on implementation specifics.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "A class Shape can define an abstract method area() for all shapes, while the specific implementations for Rectangle or Circle are hidden from the user. The user can simply call shape.area() without worrying about how the area is calculated.\n",

        "9. Supports Design Patterns\n",
        "OOP encourages the use of established design patterns, which are solutions to common problems that arise during software development.\n",
        "Design patterns like Factory, Singleton, Observer, and Strategy help organize code in a way that makes it more efficient, flexible, and maintainable.\n",
        "10. Better Collaboration\n",
        "In a team environment, OOP allows developers to work on different parts of the codebase independently. Each class or object can be developed separately, then integrated into the larger system, making team collaboration more efficient.\n",

        "1. Class Variable\n",
        "Definition:\n",
        "A class variable is shared by all instances of a class. It is defined inside the class but outside any methods.\n",
        "The class variable is bound to the class itself, not the instances, meaning all instances of the class share the same value for that variable.\n",

        "Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance.

        "\n",
        "When we loop through the list animals, which contains instances of Dog, Cat, and Cow, the speak() method is called on each object.\n",
        "Even though we’re calling the same method (speak()), Python invokes the method specific to the actual object type (dog, cat, or cow), producing different outputs.\n",

        "\n",
        "Dynamic Method Resolution (Duck Typing):\n",
        "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means polymorphism also works based on object behavior rather than class inheritance alone. If an object has a method with the right name and signature, it can be treated polymorphically, even if it doesn’t explicitly inherit from a common base class.

        "Explanation:\n",
        "The Timer class has a __call__ method that takes a function as an argument, measures its execution time, and prints the result.\n",
        "When the timer(slow_function) is called, it passes the slow_function to the __call__ method, which times the function’s execution.\n",
        "Why Use __call__?\n",
        "Making Objects Callable:\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows instances of a class to behave like functions. This is helpful in scenarios like function wrappers, decorators, or when you want to encapsulate a piece of logic within a class but still want it to be callable like a function.\n",
        "Encapsulating Logic:\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps in encapsulating complex logic inside an object and provides a clean API to use the object like a function without having to explicitly call methods.\n",
        "Stateful Callables:\n",
        "\n",
        "Objects can maintain state across multiple invocations. This makes __call__ useful when you want to create objects that behave like functions, but also need to track or modify their internal state between calls."
